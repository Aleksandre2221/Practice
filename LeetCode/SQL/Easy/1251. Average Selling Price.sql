         -- The Best Approach. Using - LEF JOIN with multiple conditions, - GROUP BY and - COALESCE -- 
SELECT p.product_id,
	COALESCE(
        ROUND(
              SUM(p.price * u.units)::numeric / SUM(u.units)
          , 2)
      , 0) average_price
FROM prices p 
LEFT JOIN unitssold u ON p.product_id = u.product_id 
	AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
