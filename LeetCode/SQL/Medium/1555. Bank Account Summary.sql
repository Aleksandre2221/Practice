         -- Approach 1. Using - UNION ALL within - LEFT JOIN -
SELECT u.user_id, u.user_name,

         -- Approach 2. Using two - CTE --

        GROUP BY paid_to

    CASE 
        WHEN (u.credit - COALESCE(p.total_paid, 0) + COALESCE(r.total_received, 0)) < 0 
        THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
